Restaurant Cuisine Classification

Objective

Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

Key Technical Details

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.
Performed label encoding for categorical variables such as 'Cuisines'.
Feature Engineering

Created additional features by encoding binary variables:
'Has Table booking'
'Has Online delivery'
'Is delivering now'
Model Training

Employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to train the model.
Model Evaluation

Achieved an accuracy of 75.8%.
Assessed the model's performance using a detailed classification report, evaluating metrics like precision and recall.
Challenge Identification

Analyzed the model's performance across different cuisines.
Identified challenges and biases for further improvements.
Summary

This project was undertaken as part of my ML internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The primary goal was to classify restaurants based on their cuisines by developing and evaluating a machine learning model. The steps included preprocessing the data, engineering features, training the SVM classifier, and evaluating its performance. Through this project, valuable insights into data preprocessing and machine learning were gained, paving the way for future advancements.
